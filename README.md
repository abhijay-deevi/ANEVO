# Overview

This game is a Roguelike RPG in which you select 1 out of 6 characters and enter the dungeon. Fight your way through past the minions which get stronger as you progress through the dungeon. Crawl through around 9 different biomes and fight the main boss at every 3 biomes. Unlock each character's story and unfold the true story.

# Gameplay

You first select 1 of 6 characters. More will be added in future updates and expansion packs which will be covered later in the document.
Once you select your character, you will be asked to select an element. You will be given 3 choices. More on elements here.

Once you select your element, you will be launched into the dungeon. Here you will have to walk through the map and defeat all the enemies that will come from different places. The map will be kind of small so you have to look through all the hidden areas to find chests and such. Monsters will spawn in every direction so be sure to kill them before they become too much to handle. Finding chests will also be beneficial. More on chests here.

Game follows basic movement mechanics with WASD and something like click to attack and 1 2 3 to activate abilities. They also move just like how the animal would move in real life and the attack animation will be the same for all abilities.

Once you defeat all the minions, the gate will open and you can progress to the next level of the dungeon. Each level of the dungeon will have a different biome which can affect your character. More on that in characters.

After each level, you will be able to choose between 3 upgrades but they won't be very good. Just some basic power increases. If you are lucky you can gain abilities and stuff.

Once you beat 3 levels (bound to change to maybe 5 levels) you will also have to defeat the main boss. More on bosses here.

This cycle repeats 3 times until you finally beat the 3rd boss. Once you beat the final boss, you will be able to exit the dungeon and gain a piece of the overarching story.

You will get to see a cutscene about the real threat that is looming on the world.

# Artwork
The artwork will be close to Unstable Games' artwork. However, we won't do the simple and small characters like the ones in Here to Slay. Here are the examples from here to slay:

These will probably just be the baby version of the animal but that's it. We will be focusing on creating big version and really cool versions like the ones they made in casting shadows.

# Characters

There are 6 playable characters (these may change): Snake, Wolf, Bear, Lizard, Monkey, Feline, and Deer. Each character will have their own mechanics as well as buffs and debuffs. For example, the snake has low movement speed, but it has an innate ability of poison which causes damage over time.

In addition, the map's environment will have an effect. For example, the ice wolf will have much more movement speed and damage in an ice biome while it will have detrimental effects in a desert biome.
At the beginning of the game you will select an additional element to add to your character. You will be able to activate this element on your animal no matter what type of animal they are.
Evolution is a core concept of this game. Each animal starts off with one character and has the potential to evolve into 4 different types of that animal. For example, here is the evolution tree for the snake:

Each evolution will have its own special abilities and can even have upgrades relating to the biome buffs. There is the ability to choose which one you want, making the game more immersive. For example, if you evolved into a Python for the first stage, you can just go up to level 30 to become an Anaconda and make it easier to fight minions, but maybe harder to fight the bosses. However, if you decided to wait until level 50, it would take a lot longer to get to it, but the rest of the game would be much easier.

Each animal will have a similiar evolution tree but the level when they evolve will change.
There will also be a mega evolution form for each character. You would need to unlock the "Mutated Core" from the main gacha and then unlock it again within the game to use the mutated core and gain a mega evolution. For example, you decided to use a wolf and followed the path to become an ice wolf. Then, if you used the mutated core, you would unlock its mutated form for a certain amount of time (like 30 seconds or so).

After the time limit is up, you will return back to the ice wolf form and have something like a 3 minute cooldown before you can mutate again.

# Elements

At the start, you have the 3 basic abilities: fire, water, grass. You will gain basic abilities or passives to start. Later on, once you open chests and such, you can gain extra abilties that correspond to the element that you selected at the beginning.

# Main Screen Gacha

There will be a main gacha at the main screen. The main gacha will cost coins that you can gain from fighting in the dungeon. In this there will be different rarity items that can be both one-time use or permanent.

One-time use items: These are items that you can only use once like health potions, mana potions, or luck modifiers.

Permanent Items: These are more rare but they can unlock hidden abilities and they can even unlock powered up abilities. Powered abilities means like an upgrade from basic fire to cursed fire. However, these permanent items need to be unlocked within the dungeon itself through chests and such to use upgrades like cursed fire.

Here are the rarities:

Common: Potions, one-run-effects like increased crit damage

Rare: Things like luck modifiers

Epic: unlock abilities. ex. gain the ability to create fire walls instead of just fireballs

Legendary: unlock upgraded elements like cursed fire

# In-game Chest Gacha

In the actual dungeon, you will be able to find chest. There will be normal chests and cursed chests.

Normal Chests: These will just be normal chests. There will be an 80% chance of just gaining a normal one-time item like potions and increased power and stuff and coins. There will be a 10% chance of getting a debuff or some kind of negative effect. There will be 9% change of gaining a new ability or something of that sort. There will be a 1% change of upgrading your element or gaining a super OP power. *percentages are bound to change

Cursed Chests: 85% chance of getting a debuff or a negative effect but it won't be too horrible. 15% chance of gaining a super overpowered ability.

For both of these chests, you can apply luck modifiers which you can gain from the main gacha as stated above. These luck modifiers will allow you to increase the change of getting a good item. Ex. Imagine you have a 5%+ modifier which basically increases the chances of good items by 5%. 

Then imagine you have 10 of those. If you apply those onto a cursed chest, then you will have an 85% chance of gaining a really good item while only 15% of getting a debuff.
# Bosses

When you fight a boss, there will be a roll system where you randomly get one out of many bosses that we have created. There is a lower chance of getting a harder boss and a much higher chance of getting an easier boss. However, easier bosses will have less worth items while harder bosses will have really good stuff.

When you first face a boss, they will take a certain amount of abilities from you and use it against you. It will be picked at random. However, they can only take up to half the amount of abilities you have.

*This is a maybe: the boss will have parts so once you destroy a part, you will gain back an ability.

Once you kill a boss, you will have 3 options to pick from and gain that ability. Most of the time it will just be basic abilities or increase in power. If you are lucky, you can gain an element upgrade like cursed fire. Lastly, if you are lucky, you can gain the boss's ability.
The boss's ability can be an element that you don't have. For example, imagine you selected the fire element, but the boss can drop a lightning element. You will be able to still use that boss's ability. However, the boss's ability will have some sort of drawback since it is really powerful.

# Enemies

The enemies will be shadows of animals from real life. These shadow animals will be considered as corrupted. Each enemy spawns based on its home habitat, for example: a shark will spawn in the water biome, and a wolf can spawn in the jungle. Each shadow animal will have an element that it uses to attack the main character as well.

It might be possible to cancel the corruption but that requires certain relics, or abilities.
# Maps

Most likely, we will make the maps by hand, but we will create a lot like 60 or so. Then, it will be randomized for every level so you could get unlock and literally get the same biome for every level. However, you will most likely get a lot of different maps. E

Each map will have some kind of buff and debuff depending on your type of animal. For example, ice wolves will have crazy good buffs in an ice biome, but will have lots of drawbacks in a desert biome.

Here is some of the biomes that will be added and some ideas for buffs and debuffs:

Snow biome (slow movement, and if temperature gets too low you take damage) Mountain biome (Rejects animals that canâ€™t climb) Jungle Biome (there can be traps) Water/ River Biome (riskier biomes) Desert Biome (slow movement, and If temperature is too high then you take more damage) Cave 

# Biomes (restricted light, fog of war effect, and trick chests) Plains Biome (normal, nothing changes, unless you have croc or slow animal)

The chests will be placed in the map at a set location every time. So if you get the same map, the chests will be at the same location. So for example, there will be 4 chests in a map and they will be at the same spot. However, each chests will have some randomization to see if the chest will actually appear. Because of this you might see all 4 chests or only 1 chest. There will be at a minimum one chest per level.
